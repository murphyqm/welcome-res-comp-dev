# Research Computing 101

First of all, **welcome to research computing!**

Welcome to the world of research computing. You might be here because you just recently started working at the University of Leeds as a postgraduate researcher doing a masters or a PhD; you might have found this link somewhere on the University of Leeds website; you may have been forwarded this link by your DTP/CDT as part of an induction; or, you may have found it while browsing ARC documentation. However you ended up here, hello!


```{admonition} Who uses research computing?
:class: dropdown

Anyone who uses a computer as part of their research process!

This may be to store and archive research data, to analyse data and create plots and figures, to perform statistical analyses, to create maps, to write manuscripts...

This includes researchers who do not use code or conduct computational models - almost all research data is either either digital or becomes digital after being digitised, and so digital data management has become an essential skill for researchers.

## What is this resource?

This documentation is a self-directed learning module targeted at a broad audience of researchers who want to learn how to be more efficient and effective in their data analysis and computing, whatever their career stage. This lesson plan has been copied and adapted from Wilson et al.
[Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing); it has been updated to be self-directed, and to include guidance and links specific to computing at the University of Leeds.

The lesson is inspired by and based on the paper, [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing (Wilson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510): "a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill".

These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources, from the daily lives of contributors, and from work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to thousands of researchers since 2010.

## But I am not a computer scientist, is research computing relevant to me?

I'll let you in on a secret... I'm not a computer scientist either. And this isn't about computer science. This is about how you use a computer in your research, be that research be art history, sociology, astrophysics, politics, languages... the list goes on. If you use a computer at any stage of your research, there will be something in this "induction" that will be useful to you. We recommend you browse the entire induction even if you reach a section that doesn't feel entirely relevant to you - you never know when you might discover a new technique or workflow that you can implement to help your research.

This self-directed course aims to provide you with tools to ensure computational reproducibility in your work, helping to create the foundations for open and reproducible research. This material has been developed and modified from a course specifically teaching scientific research computing in biology, so some of the examples will skew towards this field. We will update this documentation with newer examples from researchers as we receive feedback on this.

```{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: note

There are no specific prerequisites. Learners should be participating or intending to participate in research that involves computing. A basic knowledge of a coding language will help with the episode on Code, but this section can be skipped if irrelevant to your research.

```

Throughout this documentation, we will direct you to policies and documents prepared by the University of Leeds to help you adhere to data management requirements and other research policies. This induction material isn't meant as a replacement for those documents, but instead is designed to make them a bit more approachable, and lay out some of the reasoning behind them and the guiding principles underpinning them. The topics discussed in this induction are broadly applicable to all fields of research, but some sections may be more relevant for specific research areas (for example, software development).

```{admonition} How to use this resource
:class: tip

This documentation is built on top of a course designed to be delivered at a workshop. While it is self-directed and you can work through the material on your own, we highly recommend you work through this with a peer/cohort member/office mate, and discuss some of the questions and prompts. Also, have a look at the relevant linked University of Leeds documentation/policies etc. in each section while the topic is still fresh on your mind. Keep a note of how you intend to implement the ideas mentioned in this documentation in your own research.
