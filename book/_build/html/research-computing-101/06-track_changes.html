## Problems with change

Which of this issues can you relate to?

- I have fifteen versions of this file and I don&#39;t know which is which
- I can&#39;t remake this figure from last year
- I modified my code and something apparently unrelated does not work anymore
- I have several copies of the same directory because I&#39;m worried about breaking something
- Somebody duplicated a record in a shared file with samples
- You remember seeing a data file but cannot find it anymore: is it deleted ? Moved away ?
- I tried multiple analysis and I don&#39;t remember which one I chose to generate my output data
- I have to merge changes to a paper from mails with collaborators
- I accidently deleted a part of my work
- I came to an old project and forgot where I left it
- I have trouble to find the source of a mistake in an experiment
- My directory is polluted with a lot of unused/temporary/old folders because I&#39;m afraid of losing something important
- I made a lot of changes to my paper but only want to bring back one of paragraph
  

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Keeping track of changes that you or your collaborators make to data and
software is a critical part of research. Being able to reference or
retrieve a specific version of the entire project aids in
reproducibility for you leading up to publication, when responding to
reviewer comments, and when providing supporting information for
reviewers, editors, and readers.</p>
<p>We believe that the best tools for tracking changes are the version
control systems that are used in software development, such as Git,
Mercurial, and Subversion. They keep track of what was changed in a file
when and by whom, and synchronize changes to a central server so that
many users can manage changes to the same set of files.</p>
<p>While these version control tools make tracking changes easier, they can
have a steep learning curve. So, we provide two sets of recommendations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>a systematic manual approach for managing changes and</p></li>
<li><p>version control in its full glory,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and you can use the first while working
towards the second, or just jump in to version control.</p>
<p>Whatever system you chose, we recommend that you:</p>
<section id="back-up-almost-everything-created-by-a-human-being-as-soon-as-it-is-created">
<h2>Back up (almost) everything created by a human being as soon as it is created<a class="headerlink" href="#back-up-almost-everything-created-by-a-human-being-as-soon-as-it-is-created" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This includes scripts and programs of all kinds, software packages that
your project depends on, and documentation. A few exceptions to this
rule are discussed below.</p>
</section>
<section id="keep-changes-small">
<h2>Keep changes small<a class="headerlink" href="#keep-changes-small" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Each change should not be
so large as to make the change tracking irrelevant. For example, a
single change such as “Revise script file” that adds or changes
several hundred lines is likely too large, as it will not allow
changes to different components of an analysis to be investigated
separately. Similarly, changes should not be broken up into pieces
that are too small. As a rule of thumb, a good size for a single
change is a group of edits that you could imagine wanting to undo in
one step at some point in the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="share-changes-frequently">
<h2>Share changes frequently<a class="headerlink" href="#share-changes-frequently" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Everyone working on
the project should share and incorporate changes from others on a
regular basis. Do not allow individual investigator’s versions of
the project repository to drift apart, as the effort required to
merge differences goes up faster than the size of the difference.
This is particularly important for the manual versioning procedure
described below, which does not provide any assistance for merging
simultaneous, possibly conflicting, changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-maintain-and-use-a-checklist-for-saving-and-sharing-changes-to-the-project">
<h2>Create, maintain, and use a checklist for saving and sharing changes to the project<a class="headerlink" href="#create-maintain-and-use-a-checklist-for-saving-and-sharing-changes-to-the-project" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The list should include writing log messages that clearly explain
any changes, the size and content of individual changes, style
guidelines for code, updating to-do lists, and bans on committing
half-done work or broken code.
See [<a class="reference external" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Checklist_Manifesto.html?id=qoZCRAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">gawande2011</a>] for more on the
proven value of checklists.</p>
</section>
<section id="store-each-project-in-a-folder-that-is-mirrored-off-the-researcher-s-working-machine">
<h2>Store each project in a folder that is mirrored off the researcher’s working machine<a class="headerlink" href="#store-each-project-in-a-folder-that-is-mirrored-off-the-researcher-s-working-machine" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This may include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>using a shared system such as a (institutional) cloud or shared drive, or</p></li>
<li><p>a remote version control repository such as GitHub.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronize that folder at least daily. It may take a few minutes, but that time is repaid the
moment a laptop is stolen or its hard drive fails.</p>

## How to document a change

A good entry that documents changes should contain:

- Date of the change
- Author of the change
- List of affected files
- A short description of the nature of the introduced changes AND/OR motivation behind the change.

Examples of the descriptions are:

- Added flow cytometry data for the control and starvation stressed samples

- Updated matplot library to version 3.4.3 and regenerated figures

- Added pane with protein localization to the Figure 3 and its discussion in the text

- Reverted to the previous version of the abstract text as the manuscript reached word limits

- Cleaned the strain inventory: Recent freezer cleaning and ordering indicated a lot of problem with the strains data. The missing physical samples were removed from the table, the duplicated ids are marked for checking with PCR. The antibiotic resistance were moved from phenotype description to its own column.

- New regulation heatmap: As suggested by Will I used the normalization and variance stabilization procedure from Hafemeister et al prior to clustering and heatmap generation

The larger the project (measured either in: collaborators, file numbers, or workflow complexity) the more detailed the change description should be.
While your personal project can get away with one liner descriptions, the largest projects should always contain information about motivation behind the change and
what are the consequences.

Provided large data files are kept out of the backed-up area

<p>This manual procedure satisfies the requirements outlined above without
needing any new tools. If multiple researchers are working on the same
project, though, they will need to coordinate so that only a single
person is working on specific files at any time. In particular, they may
wish to create one change log file per contributor, and to merge those
files whenever a backup copy is made.</p>

<p>What the manual process described above requires most is
self-discipline. The version control tools that underpin our second
approach—the one we use in our own projects–don’t just accelerate the
manual process: they also automate some steps while enforcing others,
and thereby require less self-discipline for more reliable results.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><em><strong>Use a version control

<p>Box 2 briefly explains how version control systems work. It’s hard to
know what version control tool is most widely used in research today,
but the one that’s most talked about is undoubtedly Git. This is largely because of
GitHub, a popular hosting site that combines the technical infrastructure for collaboration via Git with a
modern web interface. GitHub is free for public and open source projects
and for users in academia and nonprofits.
GitLab is a well-regarded alternative
that some prefer, because the GitLab platform itself is free and open
source. Bitbucket provides free hosting
for both Git and Mercurial repositories, but does not have nearly as
many scientific users.</p>
<div class="highlight-callout notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
## Box 2: How Version Control Systems Work

A version control system stores snapshots of a project&#39;s files in a
repository. Users modify their working copy of the project, and then
save changes to the repository when they wish to make a permanent record
and/or share their work with colleagues. The version control system
automatically records when the change was made and by whom along with
the changes themselves.

Crucially, if several people have edited files simultaneously, the
version control system will detect the collision and require them to
resolve any conflicts before recording the changes. Modern version
control systems also allow repositories to be synchronized with each
other, so that no one repository becomes a single point of failure.
Tool-based version control has several benefits over manual version
control:

- Instead of requiring users to make backup copies of the whole
  project, version control safely stores just enough information to
  allow old versions of files to be re-created on demand.

- Instead of relying on users to choose sensible names for backup
  copies, the version control system timestamps all saved changes
  automatically.

- Instead of requiring users to be disciplined about completing the
  changelog, version control systems prompt them every time a change
  is saved. They also keep a 100% accurate record of what was
  *actually* changed, as opposed to what the user *thought* they
  changed, which can be invaluable when problems crop up later.

- Instead of simply copying files to remote storage, version control
  checks to see whether doing that would overwrite anyone else&#39;s work.
  If so, they facilitate identifying conflict and merging changes.

## Changelog in action

Have a look at one of the example github repositories and how they track changes:

- [data from E.R. Ballou et al. 2020](https://github.com/ewallace/pseudonuclease_evolution_2020/commits/master)
- [data from I. Boehm et al. 2020](https://github.com/BioRDM/nmj-pig/commits/main)

Give examples of:

- what makes their changelogs good?
- what could be improved?

Also, what would be the most difficult feature to replicate with manual version control?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Some good things:

- all log entries contain date and author
- all log entries contain list of files that have been modified
- for text files the actual change can be visible
- the description text gives an idea of the change

Some things that could be improved:

- The pigs files should probably be recorded in smaller chunks (commits). The raw data and cleaned data could be added separetely unless they all were captured at the same time.
- Rather than general &quot;Readme update&quot; a more specific descriptin could be provied &quot;Reformated headers and list&quot;
- Some of the Ballou et al changes could do with more detailed descriptions, for example why the change took place in case of IQ\_TREE entries

Something difficult to replicate manually:

- The changelog is linked to a complete description of the file changes.
- Click on an entry, for example `Clarify README.md` or `update readme file`, and you&#39;ll see the file changes with additions marked with + (in green) and deletions marked with - (in red).

<h2>What Not to Put Under Version Control<a class="headerlink" href="#what-not-to-put-under-version-control" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The benefits of version control systems don’t apply equally to all file
types. In particular, version control can be more or less rewarding
depending on file size and format. First, file comparison in version
control systems is optimized for plain text files, such as source code.
The ability to see so-called “diffs” is one of the great joys of version
control systems. Unfortunately, Microsoft Office files (like the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.docx</span></code> files
used by Word) or other binary files, e.g., PDFs, can be stored in a
version control system, but it is not always possible to pinpoint specific
changes from one version to the next. Tabular data (such as CSV files)
can be put in version control, but changing the order of the rows or
columns will create a big change for the version control system, even if
the data itself has not changed.</p>
<p>Second, raw data should not change, and therefore should not require
version tracking. Keeping intermediate data files and other results
under version control is also not necessary if you can re-generate them
from raw data and software. However, if data and results are small, we
still recommend versioning them for ease of access by collaborators and
for comparison across versions.</p>
<p>Third, today’s version control systems are not designed to handle
megabyte-sized files, never mind gigabytes, so large data or results
files should not be included. (As a benchmark for “large”, the limit for
an individual file on GitHub is 100MB.) Some emerging hybrid systems
such as <a class="reference external" href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a> put textual notes under
version control, while storing the large data itself in a remote server,
but these are not yet mature enough for us to recommend.</p>
<div class="highlight-callout notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
## **Inadvertent Sharing**

Researchers dealing with data subject to legal restrictions that
prohibit sharing (such as medical data) should be careful not to put
data in public version control systems. Some institutions may provide
access to private version control systems, so it is worth checking
with your IT department.

Additionally, be sure not to unintentionally place security
credentials, such as passwords and private keys, in a version control
system where it may be accessed by others.
